# GPT-3 Showcase script
A script I made to show off some functionalities of the OpenAI GPT-3 AI.

Make a config.py file in your script directory and paste your API keys in there like this:


> API_KEY = 'Your api key' 
> 
> ORG_KEY = 'Your organization key'

To get the API keys, head over the the OpenAI website and register for their GPT-3 beta programme.
